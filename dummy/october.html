    <!-- Paragraph Text -->
    <p class="mt-4">To provide Quick access to Purchase quotes submitted by vendors, a cue card has been introduced for Purchase quotes.
This functionality is available for the users having Purchaser role at the shore side	
On clicking the cue card, the system will list all purchase quotes submitted by the vendors (In approved Status)
This will help organisations to make decision at the right time and reduce the need for internal/external follow-ups.

    <h2 class="mt-5">2.2. Item selection in Purchase Documents (TFS-191069)</h2>
<p class="mt-4">To improve the usability, the system will list only those items that are mapped to the vessel  for which the purchase document is being created. This will significantly reduce the time taken to create or modify Purchase Requisition and Vessel Purchase order
Currently the system lists out all the items at the Business unit level while creating a Purchase Requisition (PR) or Direct Purchase Orders. User needs to know the item that belongs to the vessel. This is time consuming one and at times may end up in wrong item selection
